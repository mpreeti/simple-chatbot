# simple-chatbot
Created simple chatbot using Ollama model

Used Ollama open source api ie, downloaded ollama from the ollama link in the local. installed it by running Ollama run llama2 on cmd prompt. So that the llama model weights get installed and we can import the necessary libraries to run the bot.
